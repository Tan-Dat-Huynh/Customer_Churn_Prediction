# Customer_Churn_Prediction: Project Overview

In this project, I build models to predict customers that is at high risk of churn with [The Telco customer churn data](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).
- Explore the overal average churn rate.
- Build an neural network for predicting churn customers.

## Results
- The overal churn rate is *27% that high enough* (according to [Profitwell](https://www.profitwell.com/customer-retention/industry-rates), the average churn rate in telecom businesses is about 22%.) so that our business should take solution to retain our customers. 
- The neural network achieves the acuracy ~80%.
